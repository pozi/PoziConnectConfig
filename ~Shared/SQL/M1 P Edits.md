# Edit Code ‘P’

## DELWP

### Rule

Edit Code P updates property details for a given record. It requires that the Property Details are populated as required including propnum and Crefno (if used by LGA). If Crefno is left blank the existing CREFNO value in the parcel table will be retained.

### Q&A

##### When nulling out an existing property number by supplying an empty propnum, does this remove any existing address on that property?

The fact that you are using the edit code ’P’ you are only editing the property details. The addressing won’t be looked at. So the simple answer is no the existing address won’t be removed.

##### If more than one P edit record is supplied for a single property, will any of them succeed (or will they all fail)?

Where all the records contain the exact same details for any particular edit code, the first record will be loaded and the second tagged as a duplicate and returned in the load report with the following message

> ‘Duplicate record – row not required’

Where you have two records that contain different details, both records will be returned as the maintainer cannot determine which record is the correct one to load (which is part of the issue with Pozi Connect placing in a blank Propnum and then a record with the propnum – current software not looking for the ‘null’ and just identifying that they are different).

## Logic

Comparing Vicmap Parcel against Council Parcel based on a common `spi` value:

* where Vicmap property number is blank or doesn't exist in any Council Parcel, and one or more Council records have a populated property number, then update with the *first* Council property number

## SQL

[M1 P Edits.sql](https://github.com/pozi/PoziConnectConfig/blob/master/~Shared/SQL/M1%20P%20Edits.sql)

Include only Vicmap parcels that have a valid parcel description.

```sql
vp.spi <> ''
```

Include only parcels that are not multi-assessments. (Multi-assessment edits are handled by the 'A' and 'R' edits.)

```sql
vp.multi_assessment <> 'Y'
```

Include only one property per parcel. Sometimes a non-multi-assessment parcel has multiple properties because it is linked to both approved (A) and proposed (P) properties. DELWP's advice is to target the proposed one, so we select the property with the maximum value in the property status field for that particular parcel.

```sql
vp.property_pfi in ( select property_pfi from ( select property_pfi, max ( property_status ) from pc_vicmap_parcel vpx where vpx.spi = vp.spi group by spi ) )
```

Include only valid council property numbers.

```sql
cp.propnum <> ''
```

Include only parcels whose property number has a corresponding record in the Council property table or is populated with 'NCPR'. (Ideally the council data extract would include only these parcels anyway.)

```sql
cp.propnum in ( select propnum from ( cp.propnum in ( select propnum from pc_council_property_address ) or cp.propnum = 'NCPR' )pc_council_property_address )
```

Include only parcels where Vicmap and Council agree on the parcel description.

```sql
vp.spi = cp.spi
```

Add seemingly redundant filter to improve performance. Testing on Mornington Peninsula data shows 900x speed improvement when adding this filter, and 4x improvement on Casey, Stonnington and Monash. It seems that the other filters in this query that start with `vp.spi not in...` cause the query to slow down significantly unless this `vp.spi in...` filter is in place.

```sql
vp.spi in ( select spi from pc_vicmap_parcel )
```

Include only parcels from Vicmap whose `spi` is not in Council with the same `propnum`.

```sql
vp.spi not in ( select spi from pc_council_parcel where propnum = vp.propnum )
```

Include only parcels where the Vicmap and Council property numbers are different.

```sql
vp.propnum <> cp.propnum
```

Exclude matches where Vicmap parcels status is proposed and the Council property number has multiple parcels associated with it (because these could get merged in Vicmap).

```sql
not ( vp.status = 'P' and ( select cppc.num_parcels from pc_council_property_parcel_count cppc where cppc.propnum = cp.propnum ) > 1 )
```

Exclude properties being matched to an approved parcel if the number is already matched to a proposed parcel.

```sql
not ( vp.status = 'A' and cp.propnum in ( select propnum from pc_vicmap_parcel vpx where vpx.status = 'P' ) )
```

Include only parcels whose SPI is not already matched to the same property number. (Mornington Peninsula has a lot of parcels that aren't multi-assessments, but still have duplicate SPIs. If one of these parcels is already matched to the desired propnum, we shouldn't try to match it again.)

```sql
vp.spi not in ( select spi from pc_vicmap_parcel vpx where vpx.propnum = cp.propnum )
```

Exclude matches where the Vicmap parcel type is a road parcel and there is no record in the Vicmap parcel-property look-up table (because DELWP has indicated that they will not create new property polygons for these parcels).

```sql
not ( vp.road = 'Y' and vp.parcel_pfi not in ( select parcel_pfi from vmprop_parcel_property ) )
```

Exclude matches where the existing property is NCPR which has a different address to the council's address.

```sql
not ( vp.propnum = 'NCPR' and ( select ezi_address from pc_vicmap_property_address vpa where vpa.property_pfi = vp.property_pfi and vpa.is_primary <> 'N' ) <> ( select ezi_address from pc_council_property_address cpa where cpa.propnum = cp.propnum and cpa.is_primary <> 'N' ) )
```

Exclude matches where the existing property address is a complex site or otherwise has a source of 'VAC'

```sql
vp.property_pfi not in ( select property_pfi from pc_vicmap_property_address vpa where complex_site = 'Y' or source = 'VAC' )
```

Return only one record per parcel.

```sql
group by vp.spi
```
